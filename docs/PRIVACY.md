# Privacy Policy (Draft)

## Summary

"GPT LATEX Ctrl-C Ctrl-V" operates locally to transform your current browser selection into Office-compatible clipboard formats.

## Data collection

- No account creation.
- No telemetry is intentionally collected.
- No copied content is intentionally transmitted to any remote server.

## Permissions rationale

- `contextMenus`: adds a "Copy as Office Format" context menu entry (extension name: GPT LATEX Ctrl-C Ctrl-V).
- `activeTab`: allows reading the current tab’s selection/DOM when you invoke the action.
- `clipboardWrite`: writes the converted selection to the clipboard.

## Data retention

The extension does not intentionally persist copied content. Test-only bridges (used by automated fixtures) keep the last payload in-memory for verification.
